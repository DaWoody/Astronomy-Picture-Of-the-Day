## A Wordpress plugin fetching the Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) from NASA
***
### Version

1.0.1 - Minor fixes, adjusted ```readme.txt``` to have more correct instructions for Wordpress.org, adding plugin images, background images and icon images for [wordpress.org](wordpress.org).

1.0.0 - First release, includes the options ```normal``` and ```high definition``` short-codes. 

### About
This plugin utilizes the [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) open [API](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Programming_Interface) to fetch the [Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) including corresponding data.
This data can then be rendered as an ```html``` block (a wrapper div with image, header and paragraph elements) within your [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
posts or pages.
